                <p>Hello everyone! I am Morris Lam, and I have a keen passion for architecture and designs that appeal
                    to the human eye.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I often find joy in exploring the intricate details of ingame architectural structures and real life
                    buildings. For my minecraft creations, I steered myself to draw inspiration from designs from
                    Assassin's Creed, as they are critically aclaimed for their accuracy in historical architecture. In
                    my free time, I find satisfaction exploring the diverse range of architectural styles that are
                    presented by the game and the real life world. .</p>
                <p>
                    My journey to the creation of these structures all stemmed from the creation of smaller buildings.
                    During my younger days of playing this game, I would look up tutorials online on how people build,
                    along with and tips and tricks on how elements they would add in order to make the world feel alive.
                    As I grew older, I paid more attention to the architectural structures of buildings, and then
                    decided to let my imagination loose upon Minecraft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from finding interest in designing structures that appeals to myself, I've recently found the
                    enjoyment of designing user interfaces, which I also hope to appeal to people.
